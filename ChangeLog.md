## v0.15.1 at a deep development stage

A hardening and refinement release: data-safety and corruption-resistance fixes throughout the engine, faster and safer commits on Windows, a cleaner C++ API, and a new documentation site with a textbook.

### Added:

 - Added a bilingual [documentation site](https://libmdbx.dqdkfa.ru) with a ~50-example textbook and a refined API reference.
 - Added the man page for `mdbx_defrag`, updated the other man pages and every `-h` option.
 - Added `mdbx_preopen_snapinfo_ex()` with an explicit mode of processing weak checkpoints ([#182](https://github.com/Mithril-mine/libmdbx-devel/issues/182)).
 - Added the `MDBX_AVOID_FTOK` build option to avoid System V IPC key collisions ([#80](https://github.com/Mithril-mine/libmdbx-devel/issues/80)).
 - Added the `MDBX_opt_shrink_retry_period` option to rate-limit futile datafile-shrink attempts ([#170](https://github.com/Mithril-mine/libmdbx-devel/issues/170)).
 - Added the non-throwing `slice::try_as_pod<T>()`, empty on a size mismatch ([#144](https://github.com/Mithril-mine/libmdbx-devel/issues/144)).
 - Added the `mdbx.lto` and `mdbx.sanitize` options to the Conan recipe.

### Changed:

 - **Breaking:** Changed the C++ `env::mode`/`env::durability` enums to scoped; old names stay deprecated aliases.
 - Changed `mdbx_defrag` to name every stopping reason and suggest `mdbx_copy -c` for full compaction.
 - Changed Windows commit handling: doomed datafile-shrink attempts are skipped and rate-limited ([#170](https://github.com/Mithril-mine/libmdbx-devel/issues/170)).
 - Changed the `MDBX_GET_MULTIPLE` docs: a batch is a whole page of the current key's duplicates ([12/15 of #319](https://github.com/Mithril-mine/libmdbx-devel/issues/319)).
 - Changed the `mdbx_cursor_get_batch()` docs: which end-of-data code to expect in each case ([13/15 of #319](https://github.com/Mithril-mine/libmdbx-devel/issues/319)).
 - Changed the `mdbx_cursor_on_first()`/`on_last()` docs: whether moving in the direction makes sense ([14/15 of #319](https://github.com/Mithril-mine/libmdbx-devel/issues/319)).
 - Changed the C++ docs for cursor unbinding, `chk()` tables lifetime and `append_producer()` ([#91](https://github.com/Mithril-mine/libmdbx-devel/issues/91), [#143](https://github.com/Mithril-mine/libmdbx-devel/issues/143), [#145](https://github.com/Mithril-mine/libmdbx-devel/issues/145), [#146](https://github.com/Mithril-mine/libmdbx-devel/issues/146)).
 - Changed the per-fork internal cleanup logging from NOTICE to VERBOSE ([9/15 of #319](https://github.com/Mithril-mine/libmdbx-devel/issues/319)).

### Removed:

 - **Breaking:** Removed the `MDBX_CPU_WRITEBACK_INCOHERENT` build option; weakly-ordered CPUs are always assumed ([#361](https://github.com/Mithril-mine/libmdbx-devel/issues/361)).
 - **Breaking:** Removed the `MDBX_ENABLE_REFUND` build option; online auto-compactification is always enabled ([#193](https://github.com/Mithril-mine/libmdbx-devel/issues/193)).
 - **Breaking:** Removed the C++ `env::get_preopen_snapinfo()` overloads without an explicit mode argument ([#182](https://github.com/Mithril-mine/libmdbx-devel/issues/182)).

    - Fixed the C++ API not compiling in several documented configurations ([#100](https://github.com/Mithril-mine/libmdbx-devel/issues/100)).
    - Fixed overload resolution silently picking the wrong function (`if (slice)`, `move()`, `hex()`) ([#101](https://github.com/Mithril-mine/libmdbx-devel/issues/101)).
    - Fixed flags conversion dropping `MDBX_NOSTICKYTHREADS` used with `MDBX_EXCLUSIVE` ([#318](https://github.com/Mithril-mine/libmdbx-devel/issues/318)).

 - Performance:
    - Fixed the ~8x slowdown of short reads on Linux: ending a read-only transaction called `getpid()` ([#348](https://github.com/Mithril-mine/libmdbx-devel/issues/348)).
    - Fixed empty durable-mode commits still flushing the device, adding milliseconds to every no-op ([#64](https://github.com/Mithril-mine/libmdbx-devel/issues/64)).
    - Fixed every no-sync write-map commit on Windows flushing the whole mapping ([#65](https://github.com/Mithril-mine/libmdbx-devel/issues/65)).

 - Resource leaks:
    - Fixed four transaction error paths leaking table handles or promoting wrong geometry values ([#105](https://github.com/Mithril-mine/libmdbx-devel/issues/105)).
    - Fixed a memory leak on a zero-length table name.

 - Minor:
    - Fixed `mdbx_strerror()` having no message for `MDBX_BACKLOG_DEPLETED`, crashing error handlers ([#96](https://github.com/Mithril-mine/libmdbx-devel/issues/96)).
    - Fixed the non-printf logger passing the full length on truncation; the message is terminated now ([#116](https://github.com/Mithril-mine/libmdbx-devel/issues/116)).
